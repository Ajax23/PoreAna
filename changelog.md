# v0.2.3 (Upcoming)
* Add option to calculate density in the pore with a constant bin area.
* Add option to specify a upper integration limit when calculating the mean density

# v0.2.2
* Routines can save and load results in hdf5 or obj format
* Add an MC result table to compare diffusion coefficients in self-defined box areas
* Obj. and hdf5 files can be converted into a text file with the most important inputs and results
* Calculate mean density inside Pore
* Restructure sample call for new PoreMS logic - now uses YAML file as input

# v0.2.1
* Most routines are now usable for non-pore simulations
* Add MC routines for calculating diffusion and free energy profiles

# v0.2.0
* Complete restructuring/reprogramming of the code for easier expansion and testing.
