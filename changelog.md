# v0.2.2 (Upcoming)
* Routines can save and load results in hdf5 or obj format
* Add a MC result table to compare diffusion coefficients in self-defined box areas
* Obj. and hdf5 files can be convert in a text file with the most important inputs and results


# v0.2.1
* Most routines are now usable for non-pore simulations
* Add MC routines for calculating diffusion and free energy profiles

# v0.2.0
* Complete restructuring/reprogramming of the code for easier expansion and testing.
